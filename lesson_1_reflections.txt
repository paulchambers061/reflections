How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

can see the lines that have changed in either file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

can see an audit of the file changes through time 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pro having control yourself
con could miss changes if not saved or have too big,small, or unrelated commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

for ease of restore, overwrite several files. version control, and audit of changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log to see an audit of when and comments, ID of the change, diff to see change lines

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

can easily roll back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

doing version control in my work
